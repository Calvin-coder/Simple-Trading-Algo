def mean_reversion_strategy(df, window=20, threshold=1.0):
    """
    A mean reversion strategy that uses a moving average and z-score to determine positions.
    
    Parameters:
        df (pd.DataFrame): DataFrame containing a 'Close' column.
        window (int): The number of periods to calculate the moving average and standard deviation.
        threshold (float): The z-score threshold for entering a long position.
                           A lower z-score indicates that the price is below the average.
    
    Returns:
        pd.DataFrame: DataFrame with a 'Position' column where:
                      1 indicates a long position (buy) and
                      0 indicates no position (sell/exit).
